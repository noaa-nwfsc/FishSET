\arguments{
\item{dat}{Primary data frame over which to apply function. Table in FishSET 
database should contain the string `MainDataTable`.}

\item{project}{name of project.}

\item{cpue}{A string of CPUE variable names. The function outputs 
the mean CPUE by period. The variable names must match the order of variable 
names in \code{catch} and \code{names}.}

\item{catch}{A character string of names of catch variables to aggregate. The 
function outputs the total catch or share of total catch by period depending 
on the value argument. The order of the catch variable string must match those 
of the \code{cpue} and \code{names} arguments.}

\item{date}{A variable containing dates to aggregate by.}

\item{period}{Period to aggregate by. Options include 'year', month', and weeks'.}

\item{names}{An optional string of species names that will be used in the plot. If
\code{NULL}, then species names from \code{catch} will be used.}

\item{group}{A categorical variable in \code{dat} to group by.}

\item{sub_date}{Date variable used for subsetting, grouping, or splitting by date.}

\item{filter_date}{The type of filter to apply to `MainDataTable`. To filter by a 
range of dates, use \code{filter_date = "date_range"}. To filter by a given 
period, use "year-day", "year-week", "year-month", "year", "month", "week", 
or "day". The argument \code{date_value} must be provided.}

\item{date_value}{This argument is paired with \code{filter_date}. To filter
by date range, set \code{filter_date = "date_range"} and enter a  start- and 
end-date into \code{date_value} as a string: 
\code{date_value = c("2011-01-01", "2011-03-15")}. 

To filter by period (e.g. "year", "year-month"), use integers (4 digits if year, 1-2 
digits if referencing a day, month, or week). Use a vector if filtering by 
a single period: \code{date_filter = "month"} and \code{date_value = c(1, 3, 5)}. 
This would filter the data to January, March, and May. 

Use a list if using a year-period type filter, e.g. "year-week", with the 
format: \code{list(year, period)}. For example, \code{filter_date = "year-month"}
and \code{date_value = list(2011:2013, 5:7)} will filter the data table from 
May through July for years 2011-2013.}

\item{filter_by}{String, variable name to filter `MainDataTable` by. the argument 
\code{filter_value} must be provided.}

\item{filter_value}{A vector of values to filter `MainDataTable` by using the 
variable in \code{filter_by}. For example, if \code{filter_by = "GEAR_TYPE"}, 
\code{filter_value = 1} will include only observations with a gear type of 1.}

\item{filter_expr}{String, a valid R expression to filter `MainDataTable` by 
using the variable in \code{filter_by}.}

\item{facet_by}{Variable name to facet by. Accepts up to two variables. Facetting 
by \code{"year"}, \code{"month"}, or \code{"week"} is available if a date variable 
is added to \code{sub_date}.}

\item{conv}{Convert catch variable to \code{"tons"}, \code{"metric_tons"}, or 
by using a function entered as a string. Defaults to \code{"none"} for no conversion.}

\item{tran}{A function to transform the y-axis. Options include log, log2, log10, sqrt.}

\item{format_lab}{Formatting option for y-axis labels. Options include 
\code{"decimal"} or \code{"scientific"}.}

\item{value}{Whether to return raw catch ("raw") or share of total catch ('stc').}

\item{combine}{Logical, whether to combine variables listed in \code{group}.}

\item{scale}{Scale argument passed to \code{\link{facet_grid}}. Defaults to 
\code{"fixed"}. Other options include \code{"free_y"}, \code{"free_x"}, and 
\code{"free_xy"}.}

\item{output}{Output type. Options include 'table' or 'plot'.}

\item{format_tab}{How table output should be formatted. Options include \code{'wide'}
(the default) and \code{'long'}.}
}
\value{
\code{bycatch()} compares the average CPUE and catch total/share of total
  catch between one or more species. The data can be filtered by date and/or by a 
  variable. \code{filter_date} specifies the type of date filter to apply--by 
  date-range or by period. \code{date_value} should contain the values to filter 
  the data by. To filter by a variable, enter its name as a string in \code{filter_by}
  and include the values to filter by in \code{filter_value}. Only one grouping 
  variable will be displayed; however, any number of variables can be combined 
  by using \code{combine = TRUE}, but no more than three is recommended. For faceting, 
  any variable in the dataset can be used, but "year" and "month" are also available 
  provided a date variable is added to \code{sub_date}. Generally, no more than 
  four species should be compared, and even fewer when faceting due to limited 
  plot space. A list containing a table and plot are printed to the console and 
  viewer by default. For optimal plot size in an R Notebook/Markdown document, 
  use the chunk option \code{fig.asp = 1}.

Compare bycatch CPUE and total catch/percent of total catch for one or more 
species
}
\details{
Returns a plot and/or table of the mean CPUE and share of total catch or 
 raw count for each species entered. For optimal plot size in an R Notebook/Markdown 
 document, we recommend including no more than four species. The order of variables 
 in the \code{cpue} and \code{catch} arguments must be in the same order as in the 
 \code{names} argument. The \code{names} argument is used to join the \code{catch} 
 and \code{cpue} variables together.

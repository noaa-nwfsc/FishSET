\title{Check for common data quality issues affecting modeling functions}
\usage{
check_model_data(dat, project, uniqueID, latlon = NULL, save.file = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{dat}{Primary data containing information on hauls or trips. Table in 
FishSET database contains the string 'MainDataTable'.}

\item{project}{Project name.}

\item{uniqueID}{Variable in \code{dat} containing unique occurrence identifier.}

\item{latlon}{Vector of names for variables with lat, lon coordinates to be check if using 'lat-lon' as 
starting location.}

\item{save.file}{Logical, if TRUE and no data issues are identified, the dataset 
is saved to the FishSET database. Defaults to \code{TRUE}.}
}
\value{
Returns statements of data quality issues in the data. Saves table to 
  FishSET database.
}
\description{
Check the primary dataset for NAs, NaNs, Inf, and that each row 
  is a unique choice occurrence
}
\details{
It is best to check the data for NAs, NaNs and Inf, and that each row 
  is a unique choice occurrence after data creation functions have been run but 
  before making the model design file (\code{make_model_design}). These steps 
  should be taken even if the data passed earlier data verification checks, as 
  data quality issues can arise in the creation or modification of data. Model 
  functions may fail or return inaccurate results if data quality issues exist. 
  The integrated data will not save if any of these issues are in the dataset. 
  If data passes all tests, then data will be saved in the FishSET database with 
  the prefix ‘final’. The data index table will also be updated and saved.

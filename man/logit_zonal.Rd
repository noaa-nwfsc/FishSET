\usage{
logit_zonal(starts3, dat, otherdat, alts, project, expname, mod.name)
}
\arguments{
\item{starts3}{Starting values as a vector (num). For this likelihood,
the order takes: c([area-specific parameters], [travel-distance
parameters]). \cr \cr
The area-specific parameters and travel-distance parameters are of length (# of
area-specific parameters)*(k-1) and (# of travel-distance variables
respectively, where (k) equals the number of alternatives.}

\item{dat}{Data matrix, see output from shift_sort_xcpp, alternatives with
distance.}

\item{otherdat}{Other data used in model (as a list containing objects
`intdat` and `griddat`). \cr \cr
For this likelihood, `intdat` are 'travel-distance variables', which
are alternative-invariant values that are interacted with travel
distance to form the cost portion of the likelihood. Each variable
name therefore corresponds to data with dimensions (number of
observations) by (unity), and returns a single parameter. \cr \cr
In `griddat` are 'area-specific parameters' that do not vary across
alternatives, e.g. vessel gross tonnage. Each constant name therefore
corresponds to data with dimensions (number of observations) by
(unity), and returns (k-1) parameters where (k) equals the number of
alternatives, as a normalization of parameters is needed as the
probabilities sum to one. Interpretation is therefore relative to the
first alternative. \cr \cr
For both objects any number of variables are allowed, as a list of
matrices. Note the variables (each as a matrix) within `griddat` and
`intdat` have no naming restrictions. 'Area-specific parametes '
may correspond to variables that impact average catches by location,
or 'travel-distance variables' may be vessel characteristics that
affect how much disutility is suffered by traveling a greater
distance. Note in this likelihood the 'area-specific parameters' vary
across observations but not for each location: they are allowed to
affect alternatives differently due to the location-specific
coefficients. \cr \cr
If there are no other data, the user can set `griddat` as ones with
dimension (number of observations) by (unity) and `intdat` variables
as ones with dimension (number of observations) by (unity).}

\item{alts}{Number of alternative choices in model as length equal to
unity (as a numeric vector).}

\item{project}{Name of project}

\item{expname}{Expected catch table}

\item{mod.name}{Name of model run for model result output table}
}
\value{
ld: negative log likelihood

model_design_outsample(

  mod.name,
  outsample.mod.name = NULL,
  CV = FALSE,
  CV_dat = NULL,
  use.scalers = FALSE,

\arguments{
\item{project}{Name of project}

\item{mod.name}{Name of saved model to use. Argument can be the name of the model or can pull the name 
of the saved "best" model. Leave \code{mod.name} empty to use the saved "best" model. If more than
one model is saved, \code{mod.name} should be the numeric indicator of which model to use.
Use \code{table_view("modelChosen", project)} to view a table of saved models.}

\item{outsample.mod.name}{Name assigned to out-of-sample model design. Must be unique and not already exist in model design list.
If \code{outsample.mod.name = NULL} then a default name will be chosen based on mod.name, which is the default value.}

\item{CV}{Logical, Indicates whether the model design is being created for cross validation \code{TRUE}, or for simple out-
of-sample dataset. Defaults to \code{CV = TRUE}.}

\item{CV_dat}{Training or testing dataset for k-fold cross validation.}

\item{use.scalers}{Input for \code{create_model_input()}. Logical, should data be normalized? Defaults to \code{FALSE}. Rescaling factors are the mean of the 
numeric vector unless specified with \code{scaler.func}.}

\item{scaler.func}{Input for \code{create_model_input()}. Function to calculate rescaling factors.}

\description{
Use selected model design settings to create a model design for hold-out data. The hold-out data can be 
out-of-sample data or subsetted data for k-fold cross validation.
}
\details{
This function automatically pulls model settings from the selected model and creates an alternative choice matrix, expected catch/revenue matrices, 
and model design for a hold-out dataset. The hold-out data set can be an out-of-sample dataset or subset of main data for cross validation.
If running out-of-sample data, this function requires that a filtered out-of-sample data file (.rds file) exists in the output folder. For cross
validation, this function is called in the \code{cross_validation()} function.
Note: the out-of-sample functions only work with a single selected model at a time. To run out-of-sample functions on a new
out-of-sample dataset, start with load_outsample() if an entirely new dataset or filter_outsample().

\title{Import, parse, and save out-of-sample data to FishSET database}
\usage{
load_outsample(dat, project, over_write = FALSE, compare = FALSE, y = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{dat}{Out-of-sample data containing information on hauls or trips with same structure as the primary data table. 
This can be the full path to the file, the name of a out-of-sample table in the FishSET database,
or a dataframe object in the working environment. Out-of-sample tables in the FishSET 
database contain the string 'OutSampleDataTable'. A complete list of FishSET
tables can be viewed by running \code{fishset_tables()}.}

\item{project}{String, name of project.}

\item{over_write}{Logical, If \code{TRUE}, saves data over previously saved data 
table in the FishSET database. Defaults to \code{FALSE}.}

\item{compare}{Logical, whether to compare new dataframe to previously saved 
dataframe \code{y}. See \code{\link{fishset_compare}}.}

\item{y}{Name of previously saved table in FishSET Database. \code{y} must 
be defined if \code{compare = TRUE}.}
}
\description{
\code{load_outsample()} saves out-of-sample dataset to the FishSET Database (located
in the FishSETFolder) and the structure must match the primary dataset. A project must exist before 
running \code{load_outsample()}. See \code{\link{load_maindata}} to create a new project. Note: if the 
data are out-of-sample temporally then upload a new datafile, if the data are only out-of-sample spatially
then upload the primary data file in this function.
}
\details{
The out-of-sample dataset is saved in the FishSET database as raw and working tables. 
  The table name is the \code{project} and the table type, 'OutSampleDataTable'. 
  The raw table is the original, unedited table. The working table contains 
  any changes made to the table after uploading. An eight digit date string 
  is included in the name of the raw table (e.g. "pollockOutSampleDataTable20220210"). 
  The out-of-sample data is loaded into the working environment as ‘projectOutSampleDataTable’.
  The \code{fishset_compare} argument compares \code{dat} to an existing FishSET 
  table in \code{y} and returns a message noting basic differences between the two.
  The column names are checked for case-insensitivity and uniqueness.

\examples{
\dontrun{
# upload data from filepath
load_outsample(dat = "PATH/TO/DATA", project = "pollock")

# upload from dataframe in working environment
load_outsample(dat = MyData, project = 'pollock', over_write = TRUE, 
              compare = TRUE, y = 'OutSampleDataTable01012011')
              
# upload from an exisitng FishSET out-of-sample data table
load_outsample(dat = "pollockOutSampleDataTable", project = "pollock")
}
